# Lambda Function Tests

# Basic lambda with two parameters
let add = lambda(a, b) -> a + b
print "5 + 3 = " + add(5, 3)

# Lambda with no parameters  
let greeting = lambda() -> "Hello from lambda!"
print greeting()

# Lambda with one parameter
let square = lambda(n) -> n * n
print "7 squared = " + square(7)

# Lambda for string operations
let uppercase = lambda(str) -> str + " (UPPERCASED)"
print uppercase("hello world")

# More complex lambda with calculations
let distance = lambda(x1, y1, x2, y2) -> ((x2-x1)*(x2-x1) + (y2-y1)*(y2-y1))
print "Distance squared between (0,0) and (3,4): " + distance(0, 0, 3, 4)

# Using lambdas with arrays
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let multiply_by_10 = lambda(x) -> x * 10

print "Original numbers:"
for num in numbers
    print num
end

print "Multiplied by 10:"
for num in numbers  
    print multiply_by_10(num)
end
